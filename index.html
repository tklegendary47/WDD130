    <h2>TK LEGENDARY</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Takudzwa. I am 20 years old and have a strong passion for technology. I am from Harare, Zimbabwe. Ever since early childhood I have been mesmerized by computers especially when it comes to their deep sophistication. My love for technology was fueled by sci-fi movies that would involve Artificial Intelligence or even video games like the Watchdogs franchise. This gave me the adrenaline to pursue Applied Technology as a career. BYU-Idaho has given me the opportunity to make my dream a concrete reality. </p>
    <p>I am currently doing Web Fundamentals and Programming With Functions. I am so excited to be working with you all. Getting the chance to learn how to build websites and apps is truly magnificent. Watching code morphing into artistic webpages is quite ecstatic.</p>
    <p>I humbly welcome getting to know all of my classmates and hoping to prevail together in this path. </p>
    <p>Thank you for looking at my first webpage. Have a great day!</p>
