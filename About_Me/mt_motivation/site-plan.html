      <h3>Page 2- Fruitful Fiction </h3>

      <h3>Another Road To The Top Of The Mountain</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to the second page of Mount Motivation. The fictional universe can be an escape from reality or an inspiration. We
         often relate to the characters, situations theyâ€™re presented with, or words they speak. And many famous quotes have originated
          from movies, series and anime. We can even find ourselves using the quotes from our favourite scenes in our daily vocabulary and
          as a source of inspiration. Isn't that amazing? Our team has gathered enough appropriate and decent amount of content to lighten up
        the mood. In this category we also give references for shows to watch. We included some of your favorite scenes to back up the quotes.
        In the future we will be adding more features so that you will be able to share clips as well, just like what you do on TikTok
        but this time it will be for motivational purposes alone.
      </p>

      <h3>Our Goal</h3>

      <p>The reason why we added inspirational content from films and anime is because the entertainment industry is vastly growing.
        From movies to series, series to anime; every creator out there is trying to convey a message. These messages can offer lifelong
        lessons that can inspire the lowest underdog into becoming the champion of tomorrow. Many successful people started off at rock bottom.
      They got inspired by a particular scene from an anime or movie which sparked enthusiasim and optimism within them to achieve greatness.
     We as Mount Motivation aim to do the same for you. We aim to inspire and bring a smile on your face, letting you know that life is not so
    bad when you see it from a different point of view. A view that can be only experienced on the top of the mountain; on Mount Motivation :)                          </p>
