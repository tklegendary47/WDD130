    <h3>What does the site aim to achieve?</h3>
<p>
    From movies to series, series to anime; every creator out there is trying to convey a message. These messages can offer lifelong
     lessons that can inspire the lowest underdog into becoming the champion of tomorrow. Many successful people started off at rock bottom.
      They got inspired by a particular scene from an anime or movie which sparked enthusiasm and optimism within them to achieve greatness. 
      We as Mount Motivation aim to do the same for you. We aim to inspire and bring a smile on your face, letting you know that life is not 
      so bad when you see it from a different point of view. A view that can be only experienced from the top of the mountain; on Mount Motivation :)</p>
