<p>Welcome to the second page of Mount Motivation. The fictional universe can be an escape from reality or an inspiration. 
We often relate to the characters, situations they’re presented with, or words they speak. And many famous quotes have originated from movies,
 series and anime. We can even find ourselves using the quotes from our favourite scenes in our daily vocabulary and as a source of inspiration.
  Isn't that amazing? Our team has gathered enough appropriate and decent amount of content to lighten up the mood.</p>
<h2>Anime : ReLife</h2>

<div class="textA">
<p>There is that time in life whereby you feel like you’re not good enough. You begin comparing yourself to your peers 
    and see that you’re lagging far behind; thinking that you are not up to their standards. Listen, while it may be 
    as it might seem, do not workout your brain into thinking that you’re not good enough. You have worked so hard and that 
    is all that matters. Instead of focusing on other's victories and comparing yourself to them, focus on your self-improvement 
    to become better than you were yesterday.

<h2>Actor : Bruce Lee</h2>

    <div class="textB">
<p>Life isn't full of sunsets and rainbows; it's got storms and hurricanes too. Basically it's a rollercoaster rodeo. This minute
    we are happily smiling ;the next we are sad and miserable like a lost puppy in the rain. Challenges inevitably await us in 
every corner. All we can do is pray and ask God to grant us the strength to keep moving forward in hard times. </p>

    <h3>Psalms 119:176</h3>
<p>I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.</p>
